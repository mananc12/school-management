# School Management System

This is a simple frontend web-application built using React.js and a UI component library, designed for managing various aspects of a school.

2. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies

## Usage

1. Run `npm start` to start the application
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to view the application

## Technologies

- React.js
- UI Component Library (Material-UI)
- HTML/CSS

## Sidebar
This app includes a sidebar that can be opened and closed by clicking on the menu icon. The sidebar can be accessed by clicking on the menu icon located in the top left corner of the page.

The code for the sidebar can be found in the Sidebar.js file located in the src/components folder.

## Navigation
This app includes a navigation feature that allows users to move between different pages of the school management system. When a user clicks on the student, teacher, courses, or admit-card on the dashboard, they will be taken to a new page that displays the relevant information.

To implement this feature, we have used the react-router-dom library. We have defined different routes for each page of the system in the App.js file, and used the Link component from the same library to create the clickable cards.
